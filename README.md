# SMS Campaign Manager

A simple way to create an SMS Campaign for NGOs.

Many people have access to text messaging but no access to internet, making texts an important method of communication for NGOs with a wide variety of applications. For example, text message reminders for taking medication on a schedule significantly improves adherence (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22554973).

However, setting up text message communication systems generally requires an NGO to hire a developer, which is expensive and time-consuming.

Here, we provide an easy graphical interface for setting up text reminders. The interval of recurring reminders is customizable for each reminder "campaign" (e.g. each medication), and you can enroll people in a campaign via SMS. People can respond to SMS reminders to indicate they've completed a task (e.g. taken their medication).

SMS Campaign Manager is an app built on Django, the Twilio API, and a Bootstrap front-end.
